# DeepVision-Emotion-and-Gesture-Detection
- Built a Deep Learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks which can detect facial expressions
and hand gestures .
- Classified the emotion on a personâ€™s face into one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural networks
on the FER-2013 dataset which has 35887 grayscale face images with seven emotions namely angry,
disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad, and surprised.
- For gesture detection, VGG 16, a widely used convolutional neural network architecture was used as a
pre-trained model for training our new model, which could classify hand gestures like love, power, ok, victory
from the testing dataset images.
